# VirtualMemory
NAME: Andy Vera

THis is a virtual memmory project for my CPSC 351: Operating Systems course. THe purpose of this project wss for us to simulate how virtual memory along side TLB tables and main memory.

NOTES:
* I manged to get the simulation to work when there is 256 frames available (simulate_pages_frames_equal function)
* I did not manage to get the simulation where the frame where unequal (128 frame) to work (simulate_pages_frame_not_equal function)
